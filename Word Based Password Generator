# this is just a practice program and not....perfect. there's a lot more I could do with this.
# anyway this is a word based password generator
# includes all basic requirements!! caps, lower, number, special
# now it would be cool if the user could customize the words but i am lazy o-|-<

# modules
import random
import string


# greeting/context
print("Hello! You want a memorable but tough-to-crack password?? Then look no further! "
      "\nThis password is made up of simple words, one number, and a little face :)")

# password
password = ""

# password pool
words = ['dog', 'cat', 'house', 'love', 'house', 'pickles', 'easy', 'wonky', 'happy', 'deadpool', 'food', 'yummy', 'fish', 'silly','guts','quail', 'sharks', 'tofu', 'sad', 'sleepy']
numbers = string.digits
special = string.punctuation
emotes = [':D', ':0', ':P', ':C', ':V', ':I', ':X'] # by using these emotes, you can get a capital letter in the pass!!
# emotes = [':D', ':)', ':>', ':P', ';)', ':O', ':<', ':(', ';P', ':|', ':]', ':['] # <-- no caps, but more variety

# length input
length = int(input("Enter how many words you want (between 3 to 10): "))

# add a special character at beginning <-- no longer needed, but it's an option
# password += random.choice(special)

# add words
if length < 3 or length > 10:
    print("You're either going too small or too big, try something else!")
    exit()
else:
    for k in range(length):
        password += random.choice(words)
        password = password + "-"

# add number at the end
password += random.choice(numbers)

# to add an emote at the end!! gives password a capital letter :D
password += random.choice(emotes)

# print result
print("Password: " + password)

# for some reason, the words tend to duplicate in the password, even though I have a decent sized list of them.
# ig random choice isnt so random after all haha
